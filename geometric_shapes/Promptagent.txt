Interpret and identify geometric shapes based on their SVG path descriptions, taking into account the entirety of the path as a cohesive unit rather than a series of individual lines or strokes. Consider the possible closure of these paths to form complete figures, even when a closing command may not be explicitly stated. Acknowledge the presence of arcs and how they contribute to forming specific shapes like sectors or complex polygons. Enhance your reasoning to recognize when multiple path commands come together to outline shapes such as triangles, kites, or sectors, among others, from the given SVG path elements.
