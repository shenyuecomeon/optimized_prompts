### Task Description:
1. Simplify the definition of entailment by emphasizing the critical evaluation of nested beliefs or suspicions within the premise and their direct truth connection to the hypothesis, ensuring that if the premise is true,
then the hypothesis must necessarily and directly be true without ambiguity. This approach requires a clear, factual connection between premise and hypothesis, avoiding misinterpretation from subjective beliefs.
2. Define entailment as the relationship where if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true, clearly distinguishing between subjective beliefs and objective facts to avoid misinterpretation and emphasizing the necessity of a direct, unambiguous truth connection between premise and hypothesis.
### Domain Knowledge:
1. Integrate guidance on the distinction between subjective beliefs or suspicions within premises and objective statements, emphasizing that subjective contexts can complicate the directness and clarity required for entailment.
2. Add clarification on identifying direct observations versus inferences derived from indirect statements or beliefs to ensure accurate entailment judgements, and add guidance on distinguishing between first-hand observations and secondary or implied knowledge to improve entailment analysis accuracy.
3. Emphasize the importance of considering contexts where actions or outcomes are implied by the premise and understanding how these implications can lead to valid entailments.
4. Provide a more detailed explanation on handling nested beliefs or understandings within premises, including how they impact the logical flow towards the hypothesis.
### Solution Guidance:
1. Introduce a preparatory evaluation step to recognize and set aside subjective layers, such as beliefs and suspicions, in the premise before embarking on entailment analysis with the hypothesis, explicitly considering if the hypothesis's action or outcome can be reasonably deduced from the premise. Incorporate a step for analyzing the logical structure and relationship dynamics within statements, especially when beliefs or understandings are mentioned, to prevent misinterpretation.
2. Provide a strategy for assessing the extent to which a premise and a hypothesis are directly connected, emphasizing the necessity of unambiguous and factual links for valid entailment determination and include a clarification step to re-evaluate premises containing multiple subjects or changes in perspective, ensuring the model assesses entailment based on the true logical relation rather than surface-level word arrangement.
3. Advise a less rigid application of direct observation criteria in scenarios where implied actions or outcomes reasonably follow from the premises given, while integrating a proactive reassessment of premises containing nested beliefs to verify the hypothesis accurately reflects the direct belief.
4. Introduce a verification step for subjective statements: analyze whether a premise rooted in belief or suspicion directly entails the hypothesis without assuming the subjective statement establishes an objective truth. This step adds a procedural element to ensure that hypotheses are evaluated against factual premises.
### Illustrative Examples:
1. Example illustrating incorrect entailment due to the inclusion of a belief:
- **Premise**: Alice believes Bob knows the way to San Jose.
- **Hypothesis**: Bob knows the way to San Jose.
- **Clarification**: This represents a case of non-entailment because the premise relies on Alice's belief rather than objective, verifiable knowledge.
2. Example illustrating the importance of direct observation for accurate entailment judgment:
- **Premise**: John thinks Mary sees a cat under the table.
- **Hypothesis**: A cat is under the table.
- **Clarification**: Judged as non-entailment, since the premise is based on John's thought, not on direct observation or certain knowledge.
3. Example illustrating correct entailment through deduction:
- **Premise**: Chris thinks the glass fell off the table.
- **Hypothesis**: The glass is no longer on the table.
- **Clarification**: Judged as entailment because, though based on what Chris thinks, the logical outcome is a reasonable deduction from the premise. This example underscores the significance of understanding implied actions or outcomes that reasonably follow from premises given.
