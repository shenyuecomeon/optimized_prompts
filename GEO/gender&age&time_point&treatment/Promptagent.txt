### Task Description:
1. You are tasked with parsing GSM metadata from the `GEOparse` Python package into a specified format. The fields to parse include `gender`, `age`, `time_point`, and `treatment`.
### Domain Knowledge:
1. **Gender**: Parse as a string. Set to null if not mentioned. Do not use abbreviations. The options are: `male`, `female`, `misc`.
2. **Age**: Parse as a string, e.g., '5', '48'. Do not append any time units such as 'years' or 'years old'. If an age range is mentioned, include the range exactly as stated (e.g., '18-55'). Set to null if not mentioned.
3. **Time Point**: Parse as a string. Identify and explicitly use the complete descriptive phrase to indicate the collection time of the sample from the metadata. Avoid rephrasing or abbreviation. Set to null if not mentioned.
4. **Treatment**: Parse as a string based on the following criteria:
   - Identify the term `treatment` and extract the descriptive phrase following it, except when it refers to a time point (e.g., `treatment: pre`, `treatment: post`, `before treatment`, and `after treatment`).
   - For `chemotherapy: Yes`, set the field to `'chemotherapy'`.
   - If 'chemotherapy: No' is encountered, explicitly set the treatment field to null.
   - Include treatments such as 'vehicle (DMSO)' unless they are specifically used as time indicators or negated.
   - Set to null if neither applicable term is present.
### Additional Instructions:
- Directly derive terms only from explicit metadata statements without inferring beyond provided information.
- Ensure fields reflect full phrases where applicable, particularly for `time_point` and `treatment`.
- Examples of acceptable `treatment` values beyond `chemotherapy` should include `vehicle (DMSO)` and other clearly specified treatments.
- Follow the above descriptions precisely to prevent assumptions or omissions.
