### Task Description:
1. Parse the `treatment` field not only from keywords in `Sample_characteristics_ch1` but also considering the series description or general metadata context.
2. Ensure parsing includes full phrases related to `time_point` and `treatment`, maintaining exact terminology from the metadata.
3. Parse all relevant metadata fields including identifiers like `D00`, `D31` from titles, linking them appropriately to `time_point`.
4. Parse identifiers like `D00`, `D31` only when explicitly contextualized as `time_point` in other metadata fields to avoid misassignments from titles alone.
### Domain Knowledge:
1. "gender": str, set to null if not mentioned. Do not use abbreviations. The option list is: `male`, `female`, `misc`. "age": str, note the type is string, e.g., '5','48'. Do not append any time units such as 'years' or 'years old'. Set to null if not mentioned. "time_point": str, Identify the collection time of the sample, using the exact phrasing from the metadata. "treatment": str, Input the full term exactly as described, particularly with treatments like "chemotherapy". Set this value only when the terms `treatment` or `chemotherapy` are explicitly stated. However, there are two exceptions: 1. Ignore phrases which contain `treatment` but refer to `time point`, e.g., `treatment: pre`, `treatment: post`, `before treatment` and `after treatment`. 2. If you encounter 'chemotherapy: No', set the treatment field to null. If neither term is present, the default value should be set to null.
2. Introduce the concept that identifiers with patterns such as "D00" or "D31" should be validated against metadata context to confirm their indication of `time_point`. Also, consider that sample titles may contain identifiers, but metadata validation should determine their significance.
3. "treatment": str, must include comprehensive treatments explicitly described in metadata beyond just keywords like "chemotherapy".
### Illustrative Examples:
1. Example for `treatment`: If you encounter "chemotherapy: Yes", return `"treatment": "chemotherapy"`.
2. Example for `time_point`: If metadata states "samples are collected before treatment", return `"time_point": "samples are collected before treatment"`.
3. For the entry "treatment: pre", return `"time_point": "treatment: pre"`, since it is phrased as a time indicator.
4. For "Series_overall_design: ... T cell therapy and avelumab ...", extract and return `"treatment": "T cell therapy and avelumab (anti-PD-L1), from a time point of late immunotherapy resistance"`.
5. If `Sample_title` contains "D6T1" but metadata lacks other references to "D6T1" as a `time_point`, return `"time_point": null`.
### Solution Guidance:
1. Always cross-reference extracted phrases with metadata to ensure precision in terminology and contextual setting.
2. Ensure the extraction of the `time_point` uses the complete phrase in the metadata, including prefixes (e.g., "treatment:"). Also, examine general descriptions or remarks beyond structured fields for comprehensive treatment details.
3. Cross-check identifiers in sample titles with corresponding metadata fields for context before concluding they represent `time_point`. Use explicit metadata confirmation to avoid incorrect assumptions based solely on data patterns.
