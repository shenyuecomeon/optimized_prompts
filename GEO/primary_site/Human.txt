If the sample is cancer, please infer `primary_site`, i.e, the location in the body where a cancer originates based on your medical knowledge, e.g., the value is `Bone Marrow` if the sample is `leukemia`. Note that if the patient is healthy, normal, or has non-cancerous diseases, the sample has no primary site and set the value to 'null', e.g., `Chronic atrophic gastritis` is not cancer and thus has no primary site
